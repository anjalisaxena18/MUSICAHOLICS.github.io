
You can use any web development language to create a chatbot. However, if you want to use HTML and JavaScript, you can use the HTML Service of Google Apps Script.

First, create a new Google Apps Script project. Then, create an HTML file named "chatbot.html" with the following code:

<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <base target="_top"> </head> <body> <textarea id="chatbot-input" placeholder="Type your message here"></textarea> <button id="chatbot-submit">Send</button> <div id="chatbot-output"></div> <script> // Your code goes here. </script> </body> </html>

This code creates a text area and a button. The text area is where the user will type their message. The button is used to submit the message. The "chatbot-output" div is where the chatbot's response will be displayed.

Next, add the following code to the "chatbot.js" file:

function doGet(e) { return HtmlService.createHtmlOutputFromFile('chatbot'); } function processMessage(message) { // Your code goes here. }

This code defines two functions. The "doGet" function is used to display the HTML file. The "processMessage" function is used to process the user's message.

Next, add the following code to the "chatbot.html" file:

<script> function processMessage(message) { // Your code goes here. } </script>

This code calls the "processMessage" function when the user submits their message.

Now, you can add your code to the "processMessage" function. This is where you will add your chatbot's logic.

For example, you could add the following code:

if (message == 'hi') { return 'Hello, how are you?'; } else { return 'Sorry, I don\'t understand.'; }

This code checks the message and responds accordingly.

You can test your chatbot by opening the "chatbot.html" file in your browser. Type a message in the text area and click the "Send" button. You should see the chatbot's response in the "chatbot-output" div.
